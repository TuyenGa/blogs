A son and his father were walking on the mountains.

Suddenly `/ˈsʌd.ən.li/` , the son falls, hurts himself and screams: "AAAhhhhhhhhhhh!!!"

To his surprise, he hears the voice repeating `/rɪˈpiːt/`, somewhere in the mountain: "AAAhhhhhhhhhhh!!!"

Curious, he yells: "Who are you?"

He receives `/rɪˈsiːv/` the answer: "Who are you?"

Angered at the response, he screams: "Coward`/ˈkaʊ.əd/`!"

He receives the answer: "Coward!"

So, He looks to his father and asks: "What's going on?"

The father smiles and says: "My son, pay attention."

And then he screams to the mountain: "I admire `/ədˈmaɪər/` you!"

The voice answers: "I admire you!"

Again the man screams: "You are a champion!"

The voice answers: "You are a champion!"

The boy is surprised `/səˈpraɪzd/`, but does not understand.

Then the father explains: "People call this ECHO, but really this is LIFE.

It gives you back everything you say or do.

Our life is simply a reflection of our actions.

If you want more love in the world, create more love in your heart.

If you want more competence`/ˈkɒm.pɪ.təns/` in your team, improve your competence.

This relationship applies to everything, in all aspects of life. Life will give you back everything you have given to it."
